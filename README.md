# 🚀 DSA – LeetCode Daily Challenge

A dedicated repository where I solve the **LeetCode Daily Challenge** consistently.
Each folder represents one daily problem from the monthly LeetCode calendar.

This repo helps me stay consistent, track progress, and revisit optimized solutions easily.

* ✔ Daily LeetCode Challenge Problems
* ✔ Each problem stored in its **own folder**
* ✔ Solutions written in **Python**
* ✔ Uploaded execution stats (runtime + memory)
* ✔ Clean structure for scaling month-by-month
